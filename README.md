# Uncommon Python Error: ZeroDivisionError

This repository demonstrates a simple Python function that can produce a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is a common error in many programming languages, however understanding its context can be crucial to proper code error handling.

## The Bug
The `bug.py` file contains a Python function (`function_with_uncommon_error`) that raises a `ZeroDivisionError` when the input is 1. This demonstrates a scenario where not all error handling are anticipated and considered. 

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to improve the function with input validation and error handling to prevent the error and improve code robustness. 

This example provides an excellent demonstration of the importance of comprehensive error handling and input validation in programming.
